# CSGO Panorama Source Code Dumps
### I recently lost the script which did this, when I have time I'll sit down and recreate it.
This is a dump of the source code within `csgo/panorama/code.pbin` for every version of CS:GO since they released the panorama UI update. All changes are dated in the commit title, I rerun the bot which generates this every few months to add all the new updates.
