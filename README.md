# CSGOPanorama
Every Update of CSGO's Panorama Source Code with dated commits going back to the initial release of the panorama UI

There was a bot which had these going up until a few months back, 
figured it would be fun to make a bot to dump every version of the panorama source
and create a git repo of all the changes for every csgo update.

Mostly made this repo to help me find issues in csgo's ui which may result in security threats at a better rate.
This will be updated whenever i feel like re-running the script to update it.

## This code is not my own, it is the property of valve, this is just putting it in a easier place to find for those interested in looking at it.
